1. To design transistor level schematic of an Inverter using :-
    i. Complementary CMOS logic
    ii. Pseudo NMOS logic  
2. To find the effect of load capacitance on the rise time and fall time and hence delay of output waveform.  
3. To find the effect of W/L of transistors on the output waveform.

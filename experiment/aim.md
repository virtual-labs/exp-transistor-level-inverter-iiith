Inverter is a logic gate, with one input and one output. Its symbol is shown below :-

The output of inverter is complement of the input i.e. if the input is 0, the output will be 1 and vice-versa. The truth table for inverter is shown below :-

| Inout  | Output |
| -------| -------|
|   0    |    1   |
|   1    |    0   |

The transistor level schematic of inverter can be designed in many logics, following two logics will be used for designing in the experiment

1. Complementary CMOS logic
2. Pseudo NMOS logic


1. To design transistor level schematic of an Inverter using :-
    i. Complementary CMOS logic
    ii. Pseudo NMOS logic  
2. To find the effect of load capacitance on the rise time and fall time and hence delay of output waveform.  
3. To find the effect of W/L of transistors on the output waveform.

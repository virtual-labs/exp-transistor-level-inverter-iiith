# Complementary CMOS Circuit 

---

## Components Required - 

* 1 PMOS
* 1 NMOS
* 1 VDD
* 1 GND

## Circuit Connections - 

* Drag the PMOS, NMOS, VDD and GND components to the workspace
* Connect the upper node of PMOS to VDD and lower node of NMOS to GND respectively
* Connect the input terminals to the middle nodes of both PMOS and NMOS 
* Lower node of PMOS and higher node of NMOS are respectively connected to the output 

## Observations - 

* On clicking "validate" option after completing the circuit (assuming all connections are done correctly) you should see a table on the right side of the workspace
* By default, the input has been set to 1 and the corresponding output observed is 0. To check otherwise, double-click the input.

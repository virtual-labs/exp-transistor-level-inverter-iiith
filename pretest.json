        "question": "1. In inverter circuits what would be a preferred load?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "Resistor",
            "b": "MOSFET",
            "c": "Both",
            "d": "None of the above"
        },
        "correctAnswer": "b",
        "explanations": { 
        "a":"Incorrect. Resistor is not the preferred load for inverter circuits because they require a load that can be switched on and off rapidly to generate alternating current.",
        "b":"Correct. MOSFETs are preferred as loads in inverter circuits because they can switch rapidly and efficiently.",
        "c":"Incorrect. Both options are not correct; MOSFET is preferred.",
        "d":"Incorrect. One of the above answers is correct, not none."

        "question": "2. Which of the following do we prefer for a pull down device in an inverter circuit?",
        "answers": {
            "a": "NMOS",
            "b": "PMOS",
            "c": "Resistor",
            "d": "Both a and c"
        },
        "correctAnswer": "a",
        "explanations": { 
        "a":"Correct. When the input signal to the NMOS transistor is high (logic 1), it turns off, allowing the output to be pulled down to a low voltage.",
        "b":"Incorrect. PMOS transistors are used as pull-up devices, not pull-down in inverter circuits.",
        "c":"Incorrect. Resistors do not provide the active switching behavior required for efficient logic operation.",
        "d":"Incorrect. Both options are not correct; NMOS is preferred for pull-down."

        },
        "correctAnswer": "c",
        "explanations": { 
    "a":"Incorrect. CMOS inverter does not have three regions of operation.",
    "b":"Incorrect. CMOS inverter does not have four regions of operation.",
    "c":"Correct. CMOS inverter has five distinct regions of operation based on input voltage and transistor behavior.",
    "d":"Incorrect. CMOS inverter does not have two regions of operation."

            "a": "High, Low",
            "b": "High, High",
            "c": "Low, High",
            "d": "Low, Low"
        },
        "correctAnswer": "c",
        "explanations": { 
            "a":"Incorrect. A CMOS inverter has a high output impedance, meaning it provides a relatively high resistance to the external load which is not the case in reality, so option is false.",
            "b":"Incorrect. A CMOS inverter does not have both high output and input impedance.",
            "c":"Correct. A CMOS inverter has low output impedance and high input impedance.",
            "d":"Incorrect. A CMOS inverter does not have both low output and input impedance."

            "a": "0",
            "b": "VDD",
            "c": "VDD/2",
            "d": "VDD-VIN/2"
        },
        "correctAnswer": "c",
        "explanations": { 
        "a":"Incorrect. The setting the switching threshold voltage at 0 would result in an asymmetric operation of the CMOS inverter and unequal noise margins.",
        "b":"Incorrect. Setting the switching threshold voltage equal to VDD results in asymmetric operation and unequal noise margins.",
        "c":"Correct. VDD/2 as the switching threshold voltage allows for symmetric operation and equal noise margins.",
        "d":"Incorrect. This does not accurately represent the switching threshold voltage of an ideal CMOS inverter."
